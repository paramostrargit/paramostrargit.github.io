	abstract = {We use the Monte Carlo simulation technique to study the critical behavior of a three-state spin model, with bilinear and biquadratic nearest-neighbor interactions, known as the Blume–Emery–Griffiths model (BEG), in a square lattice. In order to characterize this model, we study the phase diagram, in which we identify three different phases: ferromagnetic, paramagnetic and quadrupolar, the later with one sublattice filled with spins and the other with vacancies. We perform our studies by using two algorithms: Metropolis update (MU) and Wang–Landau (WL). The critical scaling behavior of the model is complementary studied by applying results obtained by using both algorithms, while tricritical points and the tricritical scaling behavior is analyzed by means of WL measuring the joint density of states and using the method of field mixing in conjunction with finite-size scaling. Furthermore, motivated by the decoupling between spins observed within the quadrupolar phase, we further generalize the BEG model in order to study the behavior of the system by adding a next nearest neighbour (NNN) interaction between spins. We found that by increasing the strength of the (ferromagnetic) NNN interaction, a new ferromagnetic phase takes over that contains both quadrupolar and ferromagnetic order.}

  abstract = {We performed extensive simulations of the random-bond Ising model confined between walls where competitive surface fields act. By properly taking the thermodynamic limit we unambiguously determined wetting transition points of the system, as extrapolation of localization-delocalization transitions of the interface between domains of different orientation driven by the respective fields. The finite-size scaling theory for wetting with short-range fields [E. V. Albano and K. Binder, Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 036101 (2012)] establishes that the average magnetization of the sample, with critical exponent $\beta$, is the proper order parameter for the study of wetting. While the hyperscaling relationship given by $\gamma + 2\beta = \nu_{\parallel} + \nu_{\perp}$ requires $\beta = 1/2 (\gamma = 4, \nu_{\parallel} = 3, and \nu_{\perp} = 2)$, the thermodynamic scaling establishes that $\Delta_{s} = \gamma + \beta$, which in contrast requires $\beta=0 (\Delta_{s} = 4)$, where $\gamma, \nu_{\parallel}, \nu_{\perp} and \Delta_{s}$ are the critical exponents of the susceptibility, the correlation lengths parallel and perpendicular to the interface, and the gap exponent, respectively. So, we formulate a finite-size scaling theory for wetting without hyperscaling and perform numerical simulations that provide strong evidence of hyperscaling violation (i.e., $\beta = 0$) and a direct measurement of the susceptibility critical exponent $\gamma / \nu_{\perp} = 2.0 \pm 0.2$, in agreement with theoretical results for the strong fluctuation regime of wetting transitions with quenched noise.}

  abstract = {We present simulation results for an intruder pulled through a two-dimensional granular system by a spring using a model designed to mimic the experiments described by Kozlowski et al. [Phys. Rev. E 100, 032905 (2019)]. In that previous study the presence of basal friction between the grains and the base was observed to change the intruder dynamics from clogging to stick-slip. Here we first show that our simulation results are in excellent agreement with the experimental data for a variety of experimentally accessible friction coefficients governing interactions of particles with each other and with boundaries. We then use simulations to explore a broader range of parameter space, focusing on the friction between the particles and the base. We consider both static and dynamic basal friction coefficients, which are difficult to vary smoothly in experiments. The simulations show that dynamic friction strongly affects the stick-slip behavior when the coefficient is decreased below 0.1, while static friction plays only a marginal role.}
